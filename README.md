- **⚡ Fun fact:** If you have ever read a clock, or a hand watch, you have probably seen
-  “Quartz” on it. That is because each quartz clock or watch contains a small piece of quartz,
-  usually shaped like a musician's tuning fork. The battery inside a quartz clock, watch or
- timepiece sends electricity to the quartz crystal via an electronic circuit. The quartz crystal
- produces vibrations to echo around the timepiece and back into the internal forks, causing
- the fork's prongs to vibrate 32,768 times per second. The circuit measures the number of vibrations,
- and generates one electronic pulse per every 32,768 vibrations. If a quartz clock is tuned correctly,
- the vibrations should equal out to one electronic pulse per second. These pulses power the gear
- wheels forward, in turn moving the clock's hands clockwise around the clock dial.

- Can't imagine how amazing it must have felt to figure that out.
